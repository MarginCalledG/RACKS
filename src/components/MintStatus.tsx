 * Whether new RACKS can still be created.

 * dilute every holder, and no amount of locking protects against it. It is
 * exactly the kind of fact a scam frontend leaves out, so it gets stated
 * plainly in both directions.
 *
 * The undefined case renders as unknown rather than as safe. Reassuring
