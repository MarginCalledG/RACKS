/**
 * The tax for a specific trade size, resolved in the same order as
 * `Racks._taxBps` — not by asking the oracle and hoping it matches.
 *
 *   1. inLaunchWindow() -> flat 800 bps, both directions, oracle not consulted
 *   2. otherwise TwapOracle.taxBps(amount, isSell), capped at 800 bps
 *   3. oracle missing or reverting -> 400 bps
 *
 * Mirroring the contract matters more than it looks: quoting a number the
 * token won't actually charge is exactly the failure the pre-trade disclosure
 * exists to prevent, and a naive read fails in the direction that flatters us.
