 * speculation — it reproduces what the contract would return right now. That's
 * only true if we use the SAME decay curve the contract uses, and the brief
 * doesn't say which it is:
 *
 *   discrete   index(t) = (1 - r)^(t / 1 day)
 *   continuous index(t) = exp(-r * t / 1 day)
 *
 * At r = 6.9%/day these diverge by ~0.25% after a single day, which is very
 * visible on a balance. Read the index update in Racks.sol and set MODEL to
 * match. If they disagree the displayed balance drifts away from the contract
 * over the course of a session, which is exactly the failure §7 forbids.
