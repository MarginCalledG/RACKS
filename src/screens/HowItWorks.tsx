      <Field title="What RACKS is">
        <p>
          RACKS is a token that shrinks. Holding it costs you between 4.2% and
          6.9% of your balance every day, continuously, automatically. This is
          the design, not a bug and not a fee you can avoid by holding still.
          Roughly half of an unprotected balance is gone in ten to sixteen days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rate depends on how much of the total supply is locked. When more
          is locked, the rate falls; when more is free, it rises.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no single melt rate. Unlocked balances, each lock length and
          the liquidity pool are separate classes with their own rates, and the
          figures on the lock screen are read per class from the contract
          rather than quoted from a table.
        </p>
      </Field>

      <Field title="Locking">
        <p>
          Locking RACKS in a vault protects it. There are three lengths, each
          with a fee in USDG paid up front:
        </p>
        <ul>
          {tiers.map((t) => (
            <li key={t.id}>
              <strong>{t.name}</strong> — {usdg(t.feeUsdg)}.{' '}
              {t.bleedPctPerDay === 0
                ? 'Loses nothing while active.'
                : `Still loses about ${t.bleedPctPerDay}% a day.`}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <p>
          Locks expire. An expired position is not returned to you
          automatically — it starts losing {EXPIRED_BLEED_PCT_PER_DAY}% a day
          until you withdraw or relock, and relocking costs the fee again. If
          you lock and forget, you lose money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locking protects the number of tokens you hold. It does nothing for
          what they are worth. You can complete a perfect 14-day lock and
          withdraw into a lower price.
        </p>
      </Field>

      <Field title="The IRS Agent game">
        <p>
          This is a casino. Minting an agent costs {usdg(mintPrice ?? MINT_PRICE_USDG)} and
          the rank you get is random:
        </p>
        <ul>
          {ranks.map((r) => (
            <li key={r.id}>
              <strong>{r.name}</strong> — {r.mintChancePct}% chance. Wins an
              audit {r.hitRatePct}% of the time, share weight {r.weight}, costs{' '}
              {usdg(r.feedUsdg)} every three days to keep alive.
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <p>
          Three quarters of mints return the weakest rank. Each agent can audit
          once per eight-hour epoch, and winners split that epoch's pool
          between them — so a good epoch for everyone is a small payout for
          everyone. Agents you stop feeding die, stop earning, and take up a
          slot until you clear them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Winnings are not paid out automatically. You have to claim them, and
          the claim expires — after a fixed number of epochs anyone can sweep an
          unclaimed payout and it is gone. An agent can win and earn you nothing
          because you didn't open the page in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add it up before you play: the mint price, plus feed costs every three
          days for as long as you hold the agent, against a share of a pool you
          are competing for. Most agents do not earn back what they cost.
        </p>
      </Field>

      <Field title="Trading tax">
        <p>
          Buying and selling against the pool is taxed. The base rate is{' '}
          {bpsToPct(TAX.baseBps)}%, and it moves with market pressure — up to{' '}
          {bpsToPct(TAX.maxSellBps)}% on sells and {bpsToPct(TAX.maxBuyBps)}% on
          buys, down to {bpsToPct(TAX.floorBps)}% when pressure is low. The
          exact rate for your trade size is shown on the trade screen before you
          confirm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sending RACKS from one wallet to another is never taxed. Only pool
          trades are.
        </p>

      <Field title="What can go wrong">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The melt is relentless. Doing nothing is the most expensive option.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every protective action costs a fee, so small balances can be eaten
            by fees faster than by the melt.
          </li>
          <li>
            The agent game has a negative expected value for most players. Treat
            money spent there as spent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Token price is separate from token quantity. Both can fall at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            The operator can pause the agent game. Mints, feeds, audits and
            claims stop; feed timers do not, so a long enough pause can kill
            agents you have already paid for.
          </li>
          <li>
            While minting is un-renounced, the supply can grow at the owner's
            discretion and dilute you regardless of anything you do.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is unaudited software on a new chain. Smart contracts can have
            bugs that take everything, regardless of how the mechanics are
            supposed to work.

          Nothing here is financial advice, and none of it is a real tax
